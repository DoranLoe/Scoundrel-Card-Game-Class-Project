# Scoundrel-Card-Game-Class-Project
A Java based card game playable in the terminal that was initially created for a CS141 class I took.

# Contents
This repository contains:
 - Scoundrelproject.java: this is almost all of the game code, all in one giant class file.
 - Card.java: This is an object meant to represent a playing card.
 - Highscore.txt: this is a text file containing all of the highscores. 
 - Media: a file containing screenshots of the project for this readme.

# Dependancy and Installation
Download ScoundrelProject.java, Card.java, and Highscore.txt, keeping the three of them in the same file as one another.<br/>
Make sure ScoundrelProject and Card are compiled. You can do this manually in the terminal or in an IDE like Geany.

# How to execute the project
To execute the project run ScoundrelProject.class. You can do this manually in the terminal or in an IDE like Geany.

# Credits
Mostly my own work.<br/> 
[One method taken from the terminal directory given to us for the class project, which itself has a link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#getenv-java.lang.String-) <br/>
[Looked up string methods to find lastIndexOf(). found it on this site](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp)

# To-do list:
There's some things I could change or include, namely javadoc. </br>
Outside of that, I am aware of one bug in the action processing that I could fix.

# Update and change log:
-U0- </br>
Uploaded the "finished" version of the game as what was turned in for the class.
